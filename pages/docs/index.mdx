# Green Analytics Documentation

Green Analytics is an analytics framework combined with a carbon emission calculator for websites.

## Introduction

Green Analytics combines basic features from an analytics framework with a method of calculating carbon emissions. The basis for the carbon calculation method was provided by [SWD](https://sustainablewebdesign.org/). This method was then further improved using some hypothesies for carbon emissions.

## Plans

Green Analytics consists of three different plans. These three plans are:

- Free
- Pro
- Enterprise

More information about these plans and their limitations can be found on the [pricing page](/pricing#compare).

Carbon emissions are almost impossible to do an accurate estimation of as they are a long list of different variables. These include, but are not limited to:

- **Complexity of Measurement:**
  Accurately measuring carbon emissions from websites is challenging due to the complexity of the digital ecosystem. Various factors contribute, including data centers, content delivery networks (CDNs), user devices, and network infrastructure.
- **Data Center Variability:**
  Websites and online services often rely on data centers, and the carbon footprint can vary significantly depending on the energy sources and efficiency of these data centers. Some data centers use renewable energy, while others may rely on fossil fuels.
- **Dynamic Content and User Behavior:**
  The dynamic nature of web content and user behavior adds complexity to emission calculations. Content changes, user interactions, and real-time data updates can influence the energy consumption of a website.
- **Third-Party Services:**
  Many websites use third-party services, plugins, and advertisements, each contributing to the overall carbon footprint. It can be challenging to account for the emissions generated by external elements that a website incorporates.
- **User Device Variation:**
  The carbon footprint of a website also depends on the energy efficiency of the devices used by visitors. Older devices or those with lower energy efficiency may contribute more to the overall emissions.
- **Global Internet Infrastructure:**
  The internet's infrastructure, including network infrastructure and data transmission, is distributed globally. Assessing the environmental impact requires considering the energy mix and efficiency of the entire internet infrastructure, which can be challenging.

All these problems are something that have been attempted to overcome using various techniques. The project is, and will continue to be, a work in progress. This means that it will continously attempt to find better methods for measuring carbon emissions.
